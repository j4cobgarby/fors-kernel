# Debugging session with random crashes with big array

 - When I made a big big array (10,000 32 byte elements), then making a syscall from user mode would triple fault
 - Checked TSS, GDT, IDT, paging
 - For some reason, the memory where the TSS was was not paged in the user page tables
 - It was basically an off-by-one error in the create thread function.
