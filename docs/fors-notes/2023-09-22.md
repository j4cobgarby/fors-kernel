Debugging session with kernel heap initialisation

 - I got a value for the beginning of the heap's virtual address by subtracting the size of the heap from the beginning of the HHDM offset and rounding it down to the nearest multiple of the heap size (for alignment).
 - The problem was the HHDM started right at the beginning of the "higher half" of memory. Rounding down from this went from 0xffff800000000000 to 0xffff7something. This is no longer a _canonical address_.
 - I wasn't fully sure what a canonical address was, so I looked it up in the intel developer manual, and had a look at the bochs source code to see why it was erroring.
 - The fix is putting the heap after the kernel, fully in the higher half of memory. This also gives it space to grow if needs be.
